# CS-340-Final-Project
This is the final project for my databases course. It is a simple Node Express CRUD app that simulates a mountain project
(https://www.mountainproject.com/) clone.

I apologize in advance for putting everything in index.js and for not having the db connection details in my gitignore. This
project was done fairly early in my career and I've learned better since then.

Also, the db host is no longer active, so none of the db interactions will work; nor will you be able to break into the database
with the connection info.
